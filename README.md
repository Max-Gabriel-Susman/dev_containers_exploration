# Dev Containers Exploration 

Found a really cool vscode extension that should make docker image development for my argus project a lot less clunky. Gonna push the results of my evaluation of this extension to this repo.

Turns out this is a really awesome tool, I'm gonna use this in Argus and all my other projects that involve Docker going forward.
